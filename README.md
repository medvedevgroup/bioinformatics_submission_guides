#Before Submission

- read official guides carefully

- your main text can only have 8 pages, do not exceed it

- Check files you need to prepared for submission:
1. main.tex

2. main.bib

3. bioinfo.cls

4. bioinfo.sty

5. bioinfo.bst

6. supplementary.tex

7. image.eps

- All figures should be in .eps file. inkescape does a great job of converting .png or .pdf to .eps.

- Do not use subfigure or subgraph, put all subfigures into one.

- Main document should be in one .tex file.

- If you have supplementary file in .tex, it will also cause trouble. Try to use a separated bibliography citation file(.bib) different from main document file

- use linux environment to generate you pdf file, do not relay on windows system such as texstudio

- pray
